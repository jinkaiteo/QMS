|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Digital signature compliance | High | Medium | Early prototype, regulatory consultation |
| Database performance at scale | High | Medium | Load testing, optimization sprints |
| Integration complexity | Medium | High | Proof of concepts, incremental integration |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security reviews, penetration testing |

**Medium-Risk Items**
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Third-party dependency issues | Medium | Medium | Vendor evaluation, alternatives identified |
| Team knowledge gaps | Medium | Medium | Training programs, knowledge sharing |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Change control process, stakeholder management |

### Project Risks

**Resource Risks**
- **Key person dependency**: Cross-training, documentation
- **Budget overruns**: Regular budget reviews, scope management
- **Timeline delays**: Buffer time, parallel development

**Compliance Risks**
- **Regulatory changes**: Regular regulatory monitoring
- **Validation failures**: Early validation activities
- **Audit findings**: Internal audits, compliance reviews

This comprehensive roadmap provides the detailed planning framework for implementing the QMS system. The documentation suite is now complete with technical architecture, database design, API specifications, compliance requirements, and operational procedures.

Would you like me to suggest next steps for getting started with implementation, or would you prefer me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the roadmap?
