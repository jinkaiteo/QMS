# 🔒 Permission System Enhancement - COMPLETE!

## 📊 **Implementation Summary**

**Date**: $(date)
**Scope**: Role-Based Permission System Implementation
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Files Modified**: 3 service files
**TODOs Resolved**: 4 permission-related items

## ✅ **Completed Permission Enhancements**

### **1. Document Service Permission System**
**File**: `backend/app/services/document_service.py`

#### **Before**: Basic confidentiality checking only
```python
# TODO: Implement more sophisticated permission checking
# based on roles, document permissions table, etc.
return False
```

#### **After**: Comprehensive role-based document access
```python
# Hierarchical permission checking:
✅ Global document access: "document.read_all"
✅ Department-level access: "document.read_department" 
✅ Organization-level access: "document.read_organization"
✅ Owner/Author access: Direct document ownership
✅ Management override: "management.view" for department heads
```

**Permission Levels Implemented:**
- **Global Access**: Quality managers, administrators
- **Department Access**: Department managers and coordinators
- **Organization Access**: Multi-department roles
- **Ownership Access**: Document authors and owners
- **Management Access**: Hierarchical access for managers

### **2. CAPA Service Permission System**
**File**: `backend/app/services/capa_service.py`

#### **Two TODOs Resolved:**

##### **A. CAPA Action Completion Permissions**
```python
# Before: Only assignee could complete actions
# After: Management override implemented
✅ Assignee access: Original assigned user
✅ Management access: "capa.manage_all" permission
✅ Override access: "management.override" for critical situations
```

##### **B. CAPA Access Control**
```python
# Before: Basic assignee-only access
# After: Comprehensive role-based access control
✅ Global CAPA access: "capa.read_all"
✅ Department access: "capa.read_department"
✅ Organization access: "capa.read_organization"
✅ Quality event linkage: Access through related quality events
✅ Management override: "management.view_all"
```

### **3. Quality Event Service Permission System**
**File**: `backend/app/services/quality_event_service.py`

#### **Before**: Placeholder permission checking
```python
# TODO: Implement more sophisticated permission checking
# based on roles, department access, etc.
return False
```

#### **After**: Multi-layered quality event access control
```python
✅ Global access: "quality_event.read_all" for QA managers
✅ Department access: "quality_event.read_department"
✅ Organization access: "quality_event.read_organization"
✅ Reporter access: Users who reported the event
✅ Investigator access: Assigned investigators
✅ Involved user access: Users involved in the event
✅ Critical event access: "management.view_critical" for high-severity events
```

## 🏗️ **Permission System Architecture**

### **Permission Naming Convention**
```
{module}.{action}_{scope}

Examples:
- document.read_all          # Global document access
- capa.read_department       # Department-level CAPA access
- quality_event.read_organization  # Organization-level quality events
- management.view_critical   # Management access to critical items
```

### **Permission Scopes Implemented**
1. **Global** (`_all`): System-wide access across all entities
2. **Organization** (`_organization`): Access within user's organization
3. **Department** (`_department`): Access within user's department
4. **Management** (`management.*`): Special management overrides
5. **Ownership**: Direct ownership or assignment-based access

### **Module Coverage**
- ✅ **EDMS Module**: Document access control
- ✅ **QRM Module**: CAPA and Quality Event access control
- ✅ **Core Module**: Management and override permissions

## 🔐 **Security Features Implemented**

### **Hierarchical Access Control**
```python
# Permission hierarchy (most to least privileged):
1. Global permissions (read_all, manage_all)
2. Organization-level permissions
3. Department-level permissions
4. Management overrides
5. Direct ownership/assignment
6. Involvement-based access
```

### **Context-Aware Permissions**
- **Department Context**: Users can access items within their department
- **Organization Context**: Multi-department access for senior roles
- **Event Severity**: Critical events have special access rules
- **User Relationships**: Manager-subordinate relationships honored

### **Secure Defaults**
- ✅ **Deny by Default**: All access denied unless explicitly permitted
- ✅ **Multiple Check Points**: Multiple ways to gain legitimate access
- ✅ **Role Validation**: Active role and permission checks
- ✅ **Ownership Respect**: Authors/owners maintain access

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Permission Check Pattern**
```python
def _can_access_resource(self, resource, user_id: int) -> bool:
    # 1. Check ownership/assignment
    # 2. Check global permissions
    # 3. Check organization permissions  
    # 4. Check department permissions
    # 5. Check management overrides
    # 6. Check special contexts
    # 7. Deny by default
```

### **Integration with User Model**
```python
# Leverages existing User model methods:
user.has_permission(permission: str, module: str) -> bool
user.get_permissions() -> List[str]

# Uses role-based permission system:
- Active role validation
- Module-specific permissions
- JSON-based permission storage
```

### **Error Handling**
```python
# Secure error responses:
- No information leakage in permission denied errors
- Consistent error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Audit logging of access attempts
```
